String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but itâ€™s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line. The following example:

print("""\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
""")
produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):
>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'
Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.

>>>
>>> 'Py' 'thon'
'Python'
This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:

>>>
>>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
...         'to have them joined together.')
>>> text
'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'

This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:

>>>
>>> prefix = 'Py'
>>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    prefix 'thon'
                ^

>>> ('un' * 3) 'ium'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    ('un' * 3) 'ium'
                   ^
