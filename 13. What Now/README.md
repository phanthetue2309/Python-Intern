# Some Python Source get from learn : 
https://www.python.org: The major Python Web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the Web. This Web site is mirrored in various places around the world, such as Europe, Japan, and Australia; a mirror may be faster than the main site, depending on your geographical location.

https://docs.python.org: Fast access to Python’s documentation.

https://pypi.org: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop 1, is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.

https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/: The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules, and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)

http://www.pyvideo.org collects links to Python-related videos from conferences and user-group meetings.

https://scipy.org: The Scientific Python project includes modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers, random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.
